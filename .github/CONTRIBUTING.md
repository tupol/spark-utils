2. Before starting to work, make sure there is a ticket in the issue or create one first. 
   It can help accelerate the acceptance process if the change is agreed upon.

3. If you don't have write access to the repository, you should do your work in a 
   local branch of your own fork and then submit a pull request. 
   If you do have write access to the repository, never work directly on master.

4. When the work is completed, submit a Pull Request.

5. Anyone can comment on a pull request and you are expected to answer questions or to 
   incorporate feedback.

6. It is not allowed to force push to the branch on which the pull request is based.


## General Guidelines

1. It is required that the work is accompanied by unit tests.

2. The commit messages should be clear and short one lines, if more details are needed, 
   specify a body.

3. New source files should be accompanied by the copyright header.

4. Follow the structure of the code in this repository and the indentation rules used.

   
## Finding Starting Point

If you want to contribute but you don't know where to start - have a look at [enhancement](https://github.com/tupol/spark-utils/labels/enhancement) or [help wanted](https://github.com/tupol/spark-utils/labels/help%20wanted) issues.
If there aren't any, have unclear description or seem too complicated - visit [spark-utils/spark-utils](https://gitter.im/spark-utils/spark-utils) Gitter channel.
Gitter is a go-to place in case you have any questions or need guidance since we're more than happy to help new contributors regardless of their experience.
